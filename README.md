# PyBer_analysis
Visualize data from the virtual rideshare app and draw predictions/conclusions from the data.

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural). We will also be using graphs to visualize the difference between the sum of fares and their relationship with the dates of service.

# Results
A summary table is attached below and included in the Pyber_analysis repository. 

Notable results.
  - Maximum Total Rides = `1,625` (Urban)
  - Maximum Total Drivers = `2,405` (Urban)
  - Maximum Total Fares = `39,854.34` (Urban)
  - Maximum Average Fare Per ride = `$34.62` (Rural)
  - Maximum Average Fare Per Driver = `$55.49` (Rural)

# Summary 

## Highest Demand by City type

Identifying the highest demand can help management allocate Resources to the areas that most need it. According to our data, the maximum total rides, drivers, and total fares are in urban cities. The difference is big therefore more job ads and recruiters should be hired in those cities. On the other hand, rural cities have the lowest number of drivers, fares, and rides. reinforcing our suggestion to increase drivers in urban cities.

## Suggestions for Rural Cities

Rural Cities data suggest that there is a significantly lower demand which may suggest that services like response time and distribution of drivers should improve. some factors may not be related to these factors but due to this type of city having the highest fare per driver and per ride Improvement to service will only prove beneficial and profitable to both customers and drivers.

## Conclusion

This type of city is in the center when counting all possible metrics. We noticed from the chart that a spike in fares is noticed by the end of February and the end of April. This may suggest that demand is higher during this term. customer service and driver incentives should be offered during these times to ensure riders' demand is met.
