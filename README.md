# PyBer_analysis
Visualize data from virtual ride share app and draw predictions/conclusions from the data.

# Overview
The purose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the rid-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban , Rural). We wil also be using graphs to visualize the difference between the sum of fares and thier relationship with the dates of service.

# Results
A summary table is attached bellow and included to the Pyber_analysis repository. 

Notable results.
  - Maximum Total Rides = `1,625` (Urban)
  - Maximum Total Drivers = `2,405` (Urban)

# Summary 

## Highest Demand by City type

Identifing the highest demand can help managment allocate Resources to the areas that most need it. According to our data the maximum total rides , drivers and total fares are in urban cities. The difference is big therfore more job ads and recruiters shoud be hired in those cities. In the other hand rural cities have the lowest number of drivers,fares and rides. reinforcing our suggestion to increase drivers in urban citites.

## Suggestions for Rural Cities

Rural Cities data suggest that there is a significantly lower deman which may suggest that services like response time and distribution of drivers should improve. some factores may not be related to these factores but due to this type of city having the highes fare per driver and per ride Improvemnt to survice will only prove beneficial and profitable to both customers and drivers.

## Conclusion

This type of cities is in the center when counting all possible metrics. We noticed from the chart that a spike in fares is noticed by the end of february and end of april. This may suggest that demand is higher during this term. customer service and driver incentives should be offered during these times to ensure riders demand is met.
